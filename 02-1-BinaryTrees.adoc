=== Binary Trees

==== What is a Binary Tree?
_A binary tree is a tree where each non-leaf node has a *left* subtree and a *right* subtree_

_A binary tree is *not* a binary search tree - which maintains the above property but also says that:
* Everything in the *left* subtree is *less than* the value of the node.
* Everything in the *righ* subtree is *greater than* the value of the node._

In Java we can define a node as:
[source, java]
----
class TreeNode
{
    int value;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
 
    public TreeNode(int value){
        this.value = value;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
----


And the tree as a whole with:


[source, java]
----
class BinaryTree
{
    TreeNode root;
    
    public BinaryTree(){
        root = null;
    }
}
----

==== Words you should know:
* *Depth* - The *depth* of a node is *how many edges it is away from the root of the whole tree.* - Note that this means *root's depth is 0*.
* *Height* - The *height* of a node is *maximum number of edges between it and a leaf*.
* *Tree Height* - The *height of the root of the tree*.
* *Full* - A *full* binary tree is a binary tree where each of the *non-leaf nodes has two children*. 
* *Complete* - A *complete* binary tree is a binary tree where in the tree, *each level is completely filled* - _*except possibly the last*_. (i.e. *its fine if the last level isn't filled*.)
* *Perfect* - A *perfect* tree is a *full* tree where *all leafs are on the same level*.
* *Balanced Tree* - A tree where the height is O(logn).
* *Degenerate Tree* - A linked list.

=== Binary Tree Traversals
_There are *four* basic Tree Traversals. The three *Depth-First Traversals* - because they go as far deep down the tree as they can before coming back up, and *Breadth-First Traversal* a.k.a. *Level-Order Traversal* because they survey all possible things at a given level before moving down._

==== Depth First Tree Traversals

A note before we get started: often, you will hear that recursive implementations for these depth first traversals are pretty trivial. This is because the recursive implementations are essentially just the different combinations of three statements:

- Visit current node
- Recurse on current node's left
- Recurse on current node's right

Where visit is some action you want to do on the node, in the Java code I provide, it's just printing the value - but it could be something else in practice like adding the node's value to a List, or a Stack or a HashMap or whatever...

You will also note below that, by convention, *we always recurse left before right*. For In-Order Traversals of Binary Search trees, this will actually effect whether we print out the values in sorted ascending or sorted descending order, but that is for another time...

===== Pre-Order Traversal
Visit the *current node before the left then right child*. 

Recursively:

[source, java]
----
void preOrderPrint(TreeNode node){
    System.out.println(node.val);
    preOrderPrint(node.left);
    preOrderPrint(node.right);
}
----

In very straight-forward pseudo-code to help you remember it's:

[source]
----
visit(me)
recurse(me.left)
recurse(me.right)
----

The iterative (non-recursive) solution is not so easy:

[source, java]
----
void iterativePreOrder(TreeNode node){
    Stack<TreeNode> st = new Stack<>();
    if(node != null) st.push(node);
    
    while(!st.isEmpty(){
        TreeNode me = st.pop();
        System.out.println(me.val);

        if(me.right != null) st.push(me.right);
        if(me.left != null) st.push(me.left):
    }
}
----

Essentially, what we are doing is maintaining a stack to keep track of the order of visitation of the nodes. 

For a Pre-Order traversal we must ensure the following properties:

* Visit current before either sub-tree.
** Pretty trivial to see this above. We don't even touch the left or right children before printing (visiting) the current node.
* Visit entire left sub-tree before right sub-tree. 
** Stacks conserve LIFO access (Last In First Out) - by pushing right node and then left node, we ensure that at the next iteration the left-node is visited. This repeats so at the iteration after that, _it's_ left node is visited. Inductively, we visit all left subtrees before right subtrees. 

===== Post-Order Traversal
Visit the *current node after the left then right child*. 

Recursively:

[source, java]
----
void postOrderPrint(TreeNode node){
    postOrderPrint(node.left);
    postOrderPrint(node.right);
    System.out.println(node.val);
}
----

Again, with pseudo-code:

[source]
----
recurse(me.left);
recurse(me.right);
visit(me);
----

Iteratively:

[source, java]
----
void iterativePostOrder(TreeNode node){
    Stack<TreeNode> st = new Stack<>();

    if(node != null){ st.push(node); }
    TreeNode prev = null;
    while(!st.isEmpty()){
        TreeNode current = st.peek();
        if(prev == null || prev.left == current || prev.right == current){
            if(current.left != null) st.push(current.left);
            else if (current.right!= null) st.push(current.right);
            else{
                st.pop();
                System.out.println(current.val);
            }
        else if(current.left == prev){
            if(current.right != null) st.push(current.right);
            else {
                st.pop();
                System.out.println();
            }
        }
        else if(current.right == prev){
            st.pop()
            System.out.println();
        }
        
        prev = current;
    }
}
----

===== In-Order Traversal
In-order traversal has its name because *if you call it on a Binary-Search Tree (not an arbitrary Binary Tree), it will print out the values in order*. It is essentially, the last combination of the three instructions in our above pseudocode, i.e.: where you *recurse on the left child, then visit the current node, then visit the right child*. 

Recursively:

[source, java]
----
void inOrderPrint(TreeNode node){
    inOrderPrint(node.left);
    System.out.printl(node.val);
    inOrderPrint(node.right);
}
----

Pseudo-code:
[source]
----
recurse(me.left);
visit(me);
recurse(me.right);
----

Iteratively:

[source, java]
----
void iterativeInOrder(TreeNode node){
    Stack<TreeNode> st = new Stack<>();
   
    Node current = node;

    while(current != null || !st.isEmpty()){
        while(current != null){
            st.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        }
        
        current = st.pop();
        System.out.println(current.val);
        current = current.right;
    }
}
----
