==== What is a Binary Tree?
A binary tree is a tree where each non-leaf node has a *left* subtree and a *right* subtree.

A binary tree is *not* a binary search tree - which maintains the above property but also says that:

* Everything in the *left* subtree is *less than* the value of the node.
* Everything in the *right* subtree is *greater than* the value of the node.

In Java we can define a node as:
[source, java]
----
class TreeNode
{
    int value;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
 
    public TreeNode(int value){
        this.value = value;
        left = right = null;
    }
}
----


And the tree as a whole with:


[source, java]
----
class BinaryTree
{
    TreeNode root;
    
    public BinaryTree(){
        root = null;
    }
}
----

==== Words you should know:

* *Depth* - The *depth* of a node is *how many edges it is away from the root of the whole tree.* - Note that this means *root's depth is 0*. - *Sometimes people define it as number of nodes, in which case the root's depth is 1 - clarify this with your interviewer*.
* *Height* - The *height* of a node is *maximum number of edges between it and a leaf*.
* *Tree Height* - The *height of the root of the tree*.
* *Full* - A *full* binary tree is a binary tree where each of the *non-leaf nodes has two children*. 
* *Complete* - A *complete* binary tree is a binary tree where in the tree, *each level is completely filled* - _*except possibly the last*_. (i.e. *its fine if the last level isn't filled*.)
* *Perfect* - A *perfect* tree is a *full* tree where *all leafs are on the same level*.
* *Balanced Tree* - A tree where the height is O(logn).
* *Degenerate Tree* - A linked list.

=== Binary Search Trees
As mentioned above, *Binary Search Trees* are binary trees where:

* Everything in *left subtree is less than the parent node*
* Everything in *right subtree is greater than the parent node*

With a binary search tree we can, well, binary search!

==== Binary Searching on a BST

The algorithm is pretty straightforward for Binary Search Trees:

[source]
----
binarySearch(int key, TreeNode node):
    if(node == null):
        return node <1>

    if(node.val == key):
        return node <2>
    else if(node.val < key):
        return binarySearch(node.left)
    else if(node.val > key):
        return binarySearch(node.right)
----
<1> Change this to `false` if you want to return a boolean instead.
<2> Change this to `true` if you want to return a boolean instead.

Where we start the function at root, i.e. `binarySearch(key, root)`. Note that the above function returns the node where we found the value, which will be null if the value doesn't exist in the binary search tree. I provide comments to demonstrate how to change the function if we want to return a boolean instead.  

In Java Code:

[source,java]
----
TreeNode binarySearch(int key, TreeNode node){
    if(node == null || node.val == key){
        return node;
    }

    if(node.val < key) return binarySearch(node.left);
    else return binarySearch(node.right);
----

==== Inserting and Deleting Nodes in BSTs

Inserting and Deleting Nodes in a Binary Search Trees are common operations that you should be able to do. 

===== Inserting Nodes in BST

We have a *value, the key* which we want to insert into a Binary Search Tree. In order to insert it into the BST, we need to travel down the tree until we *find an appropriate slot for our new leaf*. This means we insert the values as *leafs at the bottom of the tree and not as intermediate nodes somewhere in the middle* - because it makes our life simpler.

Pseudocode:
[source]
----
insertNode(int key, TreeNode node):
    if(node == null): <1>
        return new TreeNode(key)

    if(key <= node.val): <2>
        node.left = insertNode(key, node.left)
    else: <3>
        node.right = insertNode(key, node.right)

    return node
----
<1> If the current node is null, it means we moved down the tree and found a slot for the new leaf.
<2> If the key is less than or equal to the current node's value, its appropriate slot should be somewhere in the left sub-tree, so we recurse down to the left sub-tree.
<3> If the key is greater than the current node's value, its appropriate slot should be somewhere in the right sub-tree, so we recurse down to the right sub-tree. 

Java Code:
[source,java]
----
TreeNode insertNode(int key, TreeNode node){
    if(node == null) return new TreeNode(key);

    if(key <= node.val) node.left = isertNode(key, node.left);
    else node.right = insertNode(key, node.right);

    return node;
----

===== Deleting Nodes in BST 
When deleting nodes in a BST, we have a value that we want to find and delete from the Binary Search Tree. There are 4 cases:

* The value doesn't exist in the tree.
* The node we want to delete has 0 children (leaf)
* The node we want to delete has 1 child
* The node we want to delete has 2 children

From Geeks4Geeks, here are some illustration for these cases:

*Leaf Node*:
[source]
----
              50                            50
           /     \         delete(20)      /   \
          30      70       --------->    30     70 
         /  \    /  \                     \    /  \ 
       20   40  60   80                   40  60   80
----
Pretty easy: just remove the node!

*1 Child*:
[source]
----
              50                            50
           /     \         delete(30)      /   \
          30      70       --------->    40     70 
            \    /  \                          /  \ 
            40  60   80                       60   80
----
Again, easy: remove the node and replace it with the child.

*2 Children*:
[source]
----
              50                            60
           /     \         delete(50)      /   \
          40      70       --------->    40    70 
                 /  \                            \ 
                60   80                           80
----
Here, its a little more tricky. What we'll do is remove the node (obviously) - we then need to find an appropriate node in one of the subtrees to replace this node. Logically there are two options:

* The smallest value in the right sub-tree (smallest thing that is bigger than the current node) - i.e. next biggest value.
* The largest value in the left sub-tree (largest thing that is smaller than the current node) - i.e. next smallest value.

This is called finding the *in-order successor* of the current node. I'll provide Java code below that does the first option.

[source, java]
----
TreeNode delete(int key, TreeNode node){
    if(node == null) return node; <1> 

    if(key < node.val) node.left = delete(key, node.left); <2>
    else if (key > node.val) node.right = delete(key, node.right); <3>
    else { 
        if(root.left == null) return node.right; <4>
        else if(root.right == null) return node.left; <5>
        node.val = findMin(node.right); <6>
        node.right = delete(node.val, node.right); <7>
    }

    return node;
}

int findMin(TreeNode node){
    while(node.left!=null){ <8>
        node = node.left;
    }
    return node.left.val;
}
---- 
<1> If the current node is null, we've recursed the whole tree and didn't find the value we want to delete.
<2> If the value we want to delete is less than the current node's val, then if a node exists for it, it will be in the left subtree - recurse left. 
<3> If the value we want to delete is greater than the current node's val, then if a node exists for it, it will be in the right subtree - recurse right. 
<4> We are on the node we want to delete - if it has one child - replace the node with the node that does exist, because (2) and (3) set a node's child to be whatever is returned by this call, its enough to just return the child (which would cause the current node to be abandoned).
<5> Same as above, note that if we have 0 children, then (4) will be executed and we just replace the current node with null which is the same as just deleting it. 
<6> Now we are in the case that we have two children - we need to find the minimum value in the right subtree. We set the current's node value to be that value - essentially copying that minimum node.
<7> Now we have two copies of the minimum node in the right subtree, we need to delete the one that exists in the right sub-tree - now its as if we swapped the nodes. 
<8> Finding the minimum value in a tree is trivial, just keep going to the left child until you hit the left-most leaf. Return that value.
=== Binary Tree Traversals
There are *four* basic Tree Traversals. The three *Depth-First Traversals* - because they go as far deep down the tree as they can before coming back up, and *Breadth-First Traversal* a.k.a. *Level-Order Traversal* because they survey all possible things at a given level before moving down. _

==== Depth First Tree Traversals

A note before we get started: often, you will hear that recursive implementations for these depth first traversals are pretty trivial. This is because the recursive implementations are essentially just the different combinations of three statements:

- Visit current node
- Recurse on current node's left
- Recurse on current node's right

Where visit is some action you want to do on the node, in the Java code I provide, it's just printing the value - but it could be something else in practice like adding the node's value to a List, or a Stack or a HashMap or whatever...

You will also note below that, by convention, *we always recurse left before right*. For In-Order Traversals of Binary Search trees, this will actually effect whether we print out the values in sorted ascending or sorted descending order, but that is for another time...

===== Pre-Order Traversal
Visit the *current node before the left then right child*. 

Recursively:

[source, java]
----
void preOrderPrint(TreeNode node){
    System.out.println(node.val);
    preOrderPrint(node.left);
    preOrderPrint(node.right);
}
----

In very straight-forward pseudo-code to help you remember it's:

[source]
----
visit(me)
recurse(me.left)
recurse(me.right)
----

The iterative (non-recursive) solution is not so easy:

[source, java]
----
void iterativePreOrder(TreeNode node){
    Stack<TreeNode> st = new Stack<>();
    if(node != null) st.push(node);
    
    while(!st.isEmpty(){
        TreeNode me = st.pop();
        System.out.println(me.val);<1>

        if(me.right != null) st.push(me.right);
        if(me.left != null) st.push(me.left):<2>
    }
}
----
<1> Print (Visit) - before touching sub trees.
<2> Push Right then Left so that Left is popped first (Last In First Out).

Essentially, what we are doing is maintaining a stack to keep track of the order of visitation of the nodes. 

For a Pre-Order traversal we must ensure the following properties:

* Visit current before either sub-tree.
** Pretty trivial to see this above. We don't even touch the left or right children before printing (visiting) the current node.
* Visit entire left sub-tree before right sub-tree. 
** Stacks conserve LIFO access (Last In First Out) - by pushing right node and then left node, we ensure that at the next iteration the left-node is visited. This repeats so at the iteration after that, _it's_ left node is visited. Inductively, we visit all left subtrees before right subtrees. 

===== Post-Order Traversal
Visit the *current node after the left then right child*. 

Recursively:

[source, java]
----
void postOrderPrint(TreeNode node){
    postOrderPrint(node.left);
    postOrderPrint(node.right);
    System.out.println(node.val);
}
----

Again, with pseudo-code:

[source]
----
recurse(me.left);
recurse(me.right);
visit(me);
----

Iteratively (this one is the most difficult - I suggest drawing it out):

[source, java]
----
void iterativePostOrder(TreeNode node){
    Stack<TreeNode> st = new Stack<>();

    if(node != null){ st.push(node); } <1>
    TreeNode prev = null; <2>
    while(!st.isEmpty()){
        TreeNode current = st.peek();<3>
        if(prev == null || prev.left == current || prev.right == current){ <4>
            if(current.left != null) st.push(current.left);
            else if (current.right!= null) st.push(current.right);
            else{
                st.pop();
                System.out.println(current.val);
            }
        else if(current.left == prev){<5>
            if(current.right != null) st.push(current.right);
            else {
                st.pop();
                System.out.println();
            }
        }
        else if(current.right == prev){<6>
            st.pop()
            System.out.println();
        }
        
        prev = current;<7>
    }
}
----
<1> If root not null, start the traversal.
<2> On any given iteration of the while-loop, keep track of the node we visited on the iteration before. This helps us know whether we have moved up the Binary Tree or are still moving down.
<3> We peek at the Stack (get the top value without popping it) - We only decide to remove it if we visit the node - which will only ever be done if the left and right sub-trees are visited (in that order). 
<4> This is the big one - this block says the following: Prioritize moving down the left subtree first, then the right - Only if there are no sub-trees (we're at a leaf), do you pop the node from the stack and visit it.
<5> If the last node we visited was left of the current node, it means that we've visited everything in the left sub-tree. In this case, let's start visiting the right sub-tree if it exists, otherwise pop the node and visit it.
<6> If the last node we visited was right of the current node, it means we've visited all the sub-trees (because we already enforced that left sub-tree needs to have been visited for us to start visiting the right sub-tree). In this case, there is nothing left for us to do but visit the current node and pop it from the stack.
<7> This iteration's current is next iteration's previous.

===== In-Order Traversal
In-order traversal has its name because *if you call it on a Binary-Search Tree (not an arbitrary Binary Tree), it will print out the values in order*. It is essentially, the last combination of the three instructions in our above pseudocode, i.e.: where you *recurse on the left child, then visit the current node, then visit the right child*. 

Recursively:

[source, java]
----
void inOrderPrint(TreeNode node){
    inOrderPrint(node.left);
    System.out.printl(node.val);
    inOrderPrint(node.right);
}
----

Pseudo-code:
[source]
----
recurse(me.left);
visit(me);
recurse(me.right);
----

Iteratively:

[source, java]
----
void iterativeInOrder(TreeNode node){
    Stack<TreeNode> st = new Stack<>();
   
    Node current = node;

    while(current != null || !st.isEmpty()){
        while(current != null){ <1>
            st.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        }
        
        current = st.pop(); <2>
        System.out.println(current.val);
        current = current.right; <3>
    }
}
----
<1> Keep pushing left node's onto the stack - this ensures that we visit the left subtrees first. 
<2> Pop the current node from the Stack and visit it, because of Last In First Out ordering and (1), if a node is popped, it's left sub-tree needs to have been visited. 
<3> Set the current node to be the right child so that we can now start doing the In-Order traversal for the right sub-tree.
